3. I am a first-year student at AITU (Astana IT university). Since the 9th grade, I have developed well and do not want to lose this ability. I honestly have many goals, and I donâ€™t want to kill myself with such thoughts. I told myself that I would accomplish these goals one by one without multitasking. I don't have work experience yet. I understand that developers need to develop every day and I try to follow this rule.

4. Skills:
    JS
    HTML&CSS
    Git
    Figma
    
5. Code example:
var myObj, i, j, x = "";
myObj = {
  "name":"John",
  "age":30,
  "cars": [
    {"name":"Ford", "models":["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"]},
    {"name":"BMW", "models":["320", "X3", "X5"]},
    {"name":"Fiat", "models":["500", "Panda"] }
  ]
}
for (i in myObj.cars) {
  x += "<h2>" + myObj.cars[i].name + "</h2>";
  for (j in myObj.cars[i].models) {
    x += myObj.cars[i].models[j] + "<br>";
  }
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
