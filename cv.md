3. I am a first-year student at AITU (Astana IT university). Since the 9th grade, I have developed well and do not want to lose this ability. I honestly have many goals, and I donâ€™t want to kill myself with such thoughts. I told myself that I would accomplish these goals one by one without multitasking. I don't have work experience yet. I understand that developers need to develop every day and I try to follow this rule.

4. Skills:
    JS
    HTML&CSS
    Git
    Figma
