<p>I am a first-year student at AITU (Astana IT university). Since the 9th grade, I have developed well and do not want to lose this ability. I honestly have many goals, and I don’t want to kill myself with such thoughts. I told myself that I would accomplish these goals one by one without multitasking. I don’t have work experience yet. I understand that developers need to develop every day and I try to follow this rule.</p>

<p>Skills: JS HTML&CSS Git Figma</p>

<p>Code example: var myObj, i, j, x = “”; myObj = { “name”:”John”, “age”:30, “cars”: [ {“name”:”Ford”, “models”:[“Fiesta”, “Focus”, “Mustang”]}, {“name”:”BMW”, “models”:[“320”, “X3”, “X5”]}, {“name”:”Fiat”, “models”:[“500”, “Panda”] } ] } for (i in myObj.cars) { x += “<h2>” + myObj.cars[i].name + “</h2>”; for (j in myObj.cars[i].models) { x += myObj.cars[i].models[j] + “
”; } } document.getElementById(“demo”).innerHTML = x;</p>
